v1.2 (Jan 3 2011)
------------

 * Added smart decryption of extracted cheats:
   The commands "cheats -d" and "cbc -d" tried to decrypt all codes, even if
   they were already in raw format. A mechanism has been added to detect which
   codes need to be decrypted and how. Now users can properly import "cheats"
   files with both encrypted and decrypted codes. (Suggested by dlanor)

 * Improved Makefile:
   - auto-generate version info
   - quiet build

 * Improved automated tests:
   - aggregate test results
   - create test area for each test
   - split up tests in multiple files
   - add more test data


v1.1 (Dec 21 2010)
------------------

 * Added support for "cheats" files:
   - compile your own "cheats" file which can be copied to mc0:/PCB/cheats
   - extract (and decrypt) all cheats from those files

 * Reworked command line interface (CLI).

 * Added automated tests.

 * Improved build system and added CMake listfile.


v1.0 (Apr 3 2007)
-----------------

 * Initial public release
