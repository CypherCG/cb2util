   About the File Server
---=====================---

Since the developers of CodeBreaker PS2 seem to be incapable of creating an
updated USB driver that supports newer PS2 models (SCPH-75001 and higher) and
no USB device at all can be used with these models to load Day1 Code Saves or
Game Saves, I've decided to find an alternative way. I managed to set up my own
server which hosts Day1 files and Game Saves that can be viewed and downloaded
with CB V9+.

(After all I know that the admins over at CMGSCCC won't be thankful, but hey,
it's for the community, that's all that matters.)

First, some background information: When the CB V9+ connects to the Internet to
download new Day1 Code Saves, it actually calls this PHP script:
http://www.cmgsccc.com/ps2/day1/cb.php

The tricky part is to spoof the DNS record for cmgsccc.com and mimic the PHP
script's functionality. The former changes the destination URL to, for example,
http://192.168.0.2/ps2/day1/cb.php. The latter is done by a self-written script.
With Game Saves, another script is called (.../ps2/saves/cb.php) but the
principle is the same.
This way, you can redirect all requests to your own server and provide arbitrary
Day1 files and Game Saves. Webmasters are able to set up File Servers hosting
tons of files for the community.

   Setup
---=====---

With the following instructions, I assume that your host computer's IP address
is set to 192.168.0.2. You can adapt the instructions to your own configuration,
of course.

These steps are required to run your own CodeBreaker PS2 File Server:

   1) Set up a HTTP server

I recommend installing either Apache or IIS.
Apache is free and can be downloaded from http://httpd.apache.org/
You will also need PHP, get it from http://www.php.net/
RTFM if you encounter any problems.


   2) Install the server scripts

Copy the directory "ps2" that comes with this README to the root folder of your
HTTP server. Do whatever is necessary to make both scripts ps2/day1/cb.php and
ps2/saves/cb.php accessible by your PS2.

Now, copy all Day1 files (*.cbc) you want to host on your server to ps2/day1/.
Game Saves (*.cbs) must be placed in ps2/saves/.

Test the server by opening these URLs in a browser:
http://192.168.0.2/ps2/day1/cb.php
http://192.168.0.2/ps2/saves/cb.php
You should see a list of all hosted Day1 files or Game Saves, respectively.

The file ps2/common.php holds some global defines that determine the File
Server's behavior. Check the source code for more information.

WARNING: Before setting up a CodeBreaker PS2 File Server that is connected to
the Internet, I recommend checking the PHP scripts and to add security
improvements where appropriate. I'm new to PHP and the code might be not that
perfect. ;)


   3) Set up a DNS server

In order to spoof the DNS record for cmgsccc.com, you have to run your own DNS
server. I recommend using Simple DNS Plus for Windows: http://www.simpledns.com/
(On Linux, you can use ettercap.)

In Simple DNS Plus (v4.00) go to "Records" -> "Quick Domain Wizard" and enter
the following:

Domain Name: cmgsccc.com
Web server IP: 192.168.0.2

Leave the remaining fields empty.
Press OK and you are done.

NOTE: Verify that the DNS server isn't blocked by a firewall.


   4) Change CodeBreaker's network settings

Go to "Options" -> "Internet Settings" to assign an IP address to the
PS2 and to specify your DNS server. For example:

Config: MANUAL
  IP Address: 192.168.000.010 ; PS2's IP address
 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.000
     GateWay: 000.000.000.000
DNS Server 1: 192.168.000.002 ; IP address of your DNS server
DNS Server 2: 000.000.000.000


   5) Download files

Use your CodeBreaker V9+ to view all available Day1 Code Saves (go to "Day 1" ->
Source: Internet) and Game Saves (go to "Device Manager" -> Source: Internet),
and select the ones you want to download. That's it.

NOTE: The CB checks the digital signature of Day1 files after downloading them.
There's an upgrade.bin file that allows the use of (unsigned) Day1 files for CB
V7 with CB V8+. The tool cbcMakerPS2 can create Day1 V7 files for you.
Moreover, use PS2SaveBuilder to read/write CB Game Saves.

Thanks to CMP forum member Dawnveil for inspiring me. To quote him:
"I mean, my dream would be to redirect the day1 net to my pc and somehow run a
day1 server off of that, but that's a fantasy, I'm sure."
Well, sometimes a dream comes true. ;)

Greets to all the people that contribute to our code hacking community!
